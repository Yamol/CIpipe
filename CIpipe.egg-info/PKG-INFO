Description: CRISPR has been a prevalent and powerful tool for gene editing in recent years. With the appliance of CRISPR, researchers could change DNA structures by inducing indel (insertion/deletion) at specific locus conveniently. In order to examine the efficiency of CRISPR experiment, high-through sequencing on target region will be performed, which brings the computational question. To address this issue, we developed a pipeline, 'CIpipe (CRISPR Indel pipe)', to analyze the target sequencing data for indel after CRISPR experiment. CIpipe is easy to use and can produce understandable results for paper writing quickly.
